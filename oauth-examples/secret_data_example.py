# Fill these in:
# Get these from the Twitter website, by going to
# https://apps.twitter.com/ and creating an "app"
# Don't fill in a callback_url and put in a placeholder for the website, any valid URL, e.g. http://www.programsinformationpeople.org
# Visit the Keys and Access Tokens tab for your app and grab the following two values (you'll have to expand the Access Tokens link to get the consumer secret from Twitter...)

# You should have a file like this that you add to your .gitignore every time a script you're saving depends on private data like this

# That ways anyone who uses your code can make their own e.g. secret_data.py file like this, and then ta-da, the code should work with THEIR data.
